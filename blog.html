        <h3>Computer-generated memories</h3>
        <h4>February 23, 2018</h4>

        <p>A few years ago I went on a spontaneous trip to Dripping Springs, a small town in Texas with beautiful parks and trails. I took a few photos with my phone along the way. The image below shows how my phone created a distinct "memory," including the location, days of the trip, and all of the relevant photos. It even shows me the people identified in the photos, which can bring you to a page to see all photos on your phone with that specific person.</p>

        <p>Check out the Memories feature of your phone's photo app. You may be surprised about how good it is at identifying key trips, moments, and holidays.</p>

        <p>In “The Second Coming,” David Gelernter envisioned (in the late 90s) a future where computers don’t organize and recall information in the traditional file-list manner, but instead in the same way a human does. He states that computers function primarily as file cabinets, but humans have the ability to understand the relationship between different pieces information in order to retrieve them without specific labels.</p>

        <p>Through their advanced photo algorithms, Apple and Google are one step closer to Gelernter's vision. I just took some photos over a couple days and my phone curated a page that is very representative of my trip. Just as I think of words that will trigger this memory like "Texas," "park," "late 2014," "my friend Raj," Apple is doing something very similar to put these photos together in an easily accessible manner.</p>

        <h3>Are Facebook's ad transparency efforts enough?</h3>
        <h4>January 19, 2018</h4>

        <p>The other day I was scrolling through my Facebook feed, and I accidentally clicked the "..." button on a sponsored post advertising a Volkswagen car. This revealed an interesting option: "Why am I seeing this ad?" I clicked on this and was brought to the following screen:</p>

        <img src="images/blog_facebook.jpg" width="600" alt="Screenshot of Facebook site showing ad targeting" />

        <p>Facebook has been under fire recently for their lack of transparency in regards to advertisement targeting, especially those involving politics. The image above shows how their transparency efforts fall short. As Brey mentions in "Values in technology and disclose computer ethics," "browser tracking is morally opaque because it is not well known or well understood by many people" (Brey 51). Facebook's attempt to explain where my data came from ("Oracle Data Cloud") is ambiguous.</p>

        <p>Brey's proposed solution involving informed consent may have worked years ago, when tracking was limited to cookies on your computer's browser, but today's technology infrastructure is much more complicated and spans a multitude of devices, apps, and services. Sometimes an ad on Facebook appears and you may ask yourself: "How did they know I could be interested in this product? This is eerie -- are they listening to my conversations?" Indeed, many users grant the Facebook app on their phone to access their microphone, but it appears unlikely your spoken conversations are being monitored. This recent article in CNBC by Michelle Castillo addresses this issue. It walks through the various methods Facebook uses to target audiences. While some of these methods can be directly communicated to the user, there seems to be an increased reliance on third-party data providers who do not report their exact methods. It's as if Facebook is offloading the blame of their lack of ad transparency. </p>

        <p>My group in discussion identified Facebook as the app we feel is the most morally opaque. Do you agree? Are Facebook's efforts to appear more transparent actually making them more opaque?</p>
